# Logistic-Regression-Practice:
this was done as an assignment during my learning process.
this is a logistic regression model that classifies a breast cancer tumor as Benign or malignant.
markdown cells are added between cells to explain the code workflow.
the model was found to have 5 mismatches(wrong predections) among 30 patients, but it is just for practice so it isn't a big deal.
