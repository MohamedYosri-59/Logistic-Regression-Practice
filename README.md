# Logistic-Regression-Practice:
"Coding_logistic_regression_assignment" was done as an assignment during my learning process.
this is a logistic regression model that classifies a breast cancer tumor as Benign or malignant.
markdown cells are added between cells to explain the code workflow.
the model was found to have 5 mismatches(wrong predections) among 30 patients, but it is just for practice so it isn't a big deal.
"Breast Cancer mini-project using SVM" was a complementary work using the same dataset in "Coding_logistic_regression_assignment" with some modifications, which are: 1- splitting the data into training, testing, and validation data instead of only training and testing data. 2- using Support Vector Machines (SVM) with different values of constant 'C' in our logestic regression model.
"Titanictry Classification mini-project" is just an application of SVM on a Titanic Dataset.
